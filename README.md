# simulating-blockchain-data-for-nonce-prediction-with-AI
A python-based code that simulates Bitcoin mining function for generating a dataset used in the project: nonce-prediction-with-AI. The project can be found at https://github.com/AizazSharif/nonce-prediction-with-AI

# Dataset
The dataset consists of 4 columns: open transactions (hashed), last block hash, nonce, target hash. A sample of this is already included in thie repository.
Further parameters like current block hash, timestamp and guess hashes can also be generated. Please see the script for that, all the functions needed are defined. 

# Installation and Usage
All the packages required come pre-bundled with python installations, so no need to install anything.

Clone the repo and go to directory
